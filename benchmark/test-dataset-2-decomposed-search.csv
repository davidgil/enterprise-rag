According to the data available, Apple's total net sales for fiscal year 2024 amounted to $391,035 million (or approximately $391.035 billion). This figure includes an additional $7.7 billion of revenue that was previously recorded as deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023.

In contrast, Microsoft reported a total revenue of $245.122 billion for fiscal year 2024. These figures are derived from respective documents detailing their financial performance and include comprehensive accounting of their product and service offerings during the specified period.

Comparing these revenues, it is clear that Apple had significantly higher total revenue than Microsoft in fiscal year 2024, with Apple's revenue exceeding Microsoft's by approximately $145.913 billion. This indicates a stronger financial performance for Apple in terms of net sales for that fiscal year."
