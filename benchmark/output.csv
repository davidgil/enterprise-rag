In 2023, Apple reported total net sales (revenue) of approximately $383.285 billion. Moving forward to 2024, Apple’s total net sales increased to $391.035 billion.

This increase in revenue from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to various factors, including growth across different product categories such as iPhone, Mac, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, as well as their Services sector. Additionally, it's important to note that the 2024 figure includes $7.7 billion recognized in revenue from deferred amounts initially recorded in prior years, specifically as of September 30, 2023.

Overall, Apple experienced a positive change in revenue between these two fiscal years, with an increase of approximately $7.75 billion from 2023 to 2024. This reflects not only the company's ongoing growth and success across its diverse product lines but also adjustments related to deferred revenue recognition practices."

In fiscal year 2023, Apple's total net sales were $383,285 million, as reported in Document 1. This figure includes an additional $8.2 billion of deferred revenue recognized during that year.

For the subsequent year, 2024, Apple's total net sales increased to $391,035 million according to the same document, which incorporates $7.7 billion of deferred revenue recognized within that fiscal period.

To calculate the growth rate in revenue from 2023 to 2024, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue}_{2024} - \text{Revenue}_{2023}}{\text{Revenue}_{2023}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting in the values from above:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{391,035 - 383,285}{383,285} \right) \times 100 \approx \left( \frac{7,750}{383,285} \right) \times 100 \approx 2.02\%

In 2022, Apple reported total net sales of $394,328 million (or $394.328 billion). This figure includes a specific portion of deferred revenue recognized in the same year amounting to $7.5 billion from previous commitments as of September 25, 2021.

For the fiscal year 2023, Apple's total net sales were reported at $383,285 million (or $383.285 billion). The document indicates that this figure also encompasses deferred revenue recognized in 2023 amounting to $8.2 billion from previous commitments as of September 24, 2022, and the previously mentioned $7.5 billion recognized in the prior year.

To calculate the growth rate, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue in 2023} - \text{Revenue in 2022}}{\text{Revenue in 2022}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting in the given values:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{383.285 - 394.328}{394.328} \right) \times 100
\]

This calculation gives a result of approximately -2.76%. 

Thus, Apple experienced a revenue decline of about 2.76% from 2022 to 2023."

The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany  transactions  and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets, liabilities,  revenue,  and  expenses.  Examples  of  estimates  and  assumptions  include:  for  revenue  recognition,  determining  the  nature  and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price ('SSP') of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  and  collaboration  applications,  server  applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\n\n## PART II Item 8\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n"", 'total_chunks': 236, 'score': 0.8118143}]}]";8;Revenue increased by 16% compared to fiscal year 2023​;"To determine the revenue growth percentage for Microsoft in fiscal year 2024, we need to compare its total revenues for fiscal years 2023 and 2024. 

In fiscal year 2023, which ended on June 30, Microsoft's total revenue was $211.9 billion. By the end of fiscal year 2024, on June 30, 2025, the company reported a total revenue of $245.122 billion.

The formula to calculate the growth percentage is:

\[
\text{Growth Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue in 2024} - \text{Revenue in 2023}}{\text{Revenue in 2023}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Growth Percentage} = \left( \frac{245.122 - 211.9}{211.9} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Growth Percentage} = \left( \frac{33.222}{211.9} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Growth Percentage} \approx 15.67\%
\]

Therefore, Microsoft's revenue growth percentage for fiscal year 2024 was approximately 15.67%."

The segment generated a total of $78,356 million in revenue for the year, marking an increase from $69,274 million in 2023. This significant rise can be attributed to several key components within the segment:

1. **Office Commercial Products and Cloud Services**: This category saw its revenue grow by $5.8 billion or 14%, driven largely by a 16% growth in Office 365 Commercial revenue, which benefited from increased seat sales (7%) and improvements in revenue per user. The increase was particularly notable among small and medium businesses and frontline workers. However, there was also a shift towards cloud offerings, leading to a decrease in revenue for traditional on-premises Office products.

2. **Office Consumer Products and Cloud Services**: This area experienced a revenue growth of $237 million or 4%, bolstered by an increase in Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers to 82.5 million, representing a 10% rise from the previous year.

3. **LinkedIn**: Revenue for LinkedIn increased by $1.4 billion or 9%. The growth was driven across all its business lines: Talent Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, Marketing Solutions, and Sales Solutions all saw increases.

4. **Dynamics Products and Cloud Services**: This segment reported a revenue increase of $1.0 billion or 19%, primarily due to a 24% rise in Dynamics 365's revenue, which offers intelligent cloud-based applications across various business functions including ERP and CRM.

Additionally, the operating income for the Productivity and Business Processes segment increased by $6.4 billion or 19%, supported by an enhanced gross margin of $6.5 billion or 12%. The gross margin percentage saw a slight improvement, even as accounting estimate changes affected overall figures. Operating expenses were relatively stable, increasing only slightly by 1%.

Overall, the significant revenue increases and operational efficiencies contributed to strong performance for the Productivity and Business Processes segment in fiscal year 2024."

Based on the available information:

1. **Total Revenues**: For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, Microsoft reported total revenues amounting to $245.1 billion.

2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Unfortunately, there is no specific data provided regarding COGS for this period in the documents retrieved. The available information primarily covers operating expenses, research and development costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, revenue recognition policies, and segment performance but lacks a detailed breakdown of COGS.

Since the gross margin is calculated as \((\text{Total Revenues} - \text{COGS}) / \text{Total Revenues}\), the absence of specific COGS data means we cannot accurately calculate or provide Microsoft's gross margin for fiscal year 2024.

According to Document 1, Microsoft's total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, was $245.122 billion. The same document outlines that the total operating expenses amounted to $57.467 billion.

However, a more detailed breakdown of operating expenses from Document 2 provides additional insights: 
- Research and Development expenses were $29.510 billion.
- Sales and Marketing expenses stood at $24.456 billion.
- General and Administrative expenses came to $7.609 billion.

Adding these components together yields the total operating expenses:
\[ \text{Total Operating Expenses} = \$29,510 \, \text{million} + \$24,456 \, \text{million} + \$7,609 \, \text{million} = \$61,575 \, \text{million}. \]

To calculate the operating income, we use the formula: 
\[ \text{Operating Income} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Operating Expenses}. \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ \text{Operating Income} = \$245,122 \, \text{million} - \$61,575 \, \text{million} = \$183,547 \, \text{million}. \]

Thus, Microsoft's operating income for fiscal year 2024 is $183.547 billion. This comprehensive calculation integrates total revenue and the detailed components of operating expenses to arrive at the final operating income figure."

1. **Total Revenue**: For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, Microsoft reported a total revenue of $245,122 million. This figure represents the aggregate earnings from their various product and service offerings.

2. **Operating Expenses**: The company's operating expenses for this period amounted to $57,467 million. These expenses are categorized into Research and Development ($31,370 million) and Selling, General and Administrative costs ($26,097 million). Additionally, a separate provision of $29,749 million was recorded for income taxes.

3. **Calculation of Net Income**: To compute net income, we start with Microsoft's ""Income Before Income Taxes,"" which was reported as $107,787 million. From this, the company subtracted its provision for income taxes, amounting to $19,651 million. This calculation is critical in determining the final net income:

   \[
   \text{Net Income} = \text{Income Before Income Taxes} - \text{Provision for Income Taxes}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Net Income} = 107,787 - 19,651 = 88,136

Here is a comprehensive synthesis of the relevant information:

1. **Total Earnings**: For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, Microsoft reported net income totaling $88.136 billion.

2. **Shares Outstanding**: The average number of common stock shares outstanding for the fiscal year can be calculated by averaging the beginning and end-of-year figures:
   - Beginning of the Year (July 1, 2023): 7,464 million shares
   - End of the Year (June 30, 2024): 7,434 million shares

   The average number of shares outstanding is therefore approximately 7.449 billion shares.

3. **EPS Calculation**: Earnings per share (EPS) measures profitability on a per-share basis and can be calculated using two methods: basic EPS and diluted EPS.
   - **Basic EPS** involves dividing the net income by the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding:
     \[
     \text{Basic EPS} = \frac{\$88.136 \text{ billion}}{7.449 \text{ billion shares}} \approx \$11.83
     \]
   - **Diluted EPS** accounts for all potential dilutive securities and uses a slightly higher number of weighted average shares, though the exact figure wasn't provided here. However, past data indicates that diluted shares tend to be marginally higher than basic shares.

Based on these calculations, Microsoft's basic earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2024 is approximately $11.83. This calculation provides insight into how much of Microsoft's net income was attributable to each outstanding share during the fiscal year."

The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.\n\nThe  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  ('OECD')  published  its  model  rules  'Tax  Challenges  Arising  From  the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)' which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment ('NOPAs') from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax  years  1996  to  2023,  some  of  which  are  currently  under  audit  by  local  tax  authorities.  The  resolution  of  each  of  these  audits  is  not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to  our  hardware  portfolio,  and  costs  related  to  lease  consolidation  activities.  We  believe  these  non-GAAP  measures  aid  investors  by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These nonGAAP  financial  measures  presented  should  not  be  considered  a  substitute  for,  or  superior  to,  the  measures  of  financial  performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n"", 'total_chunks': 236, 'score': 0.81695986}, {'id': 'microsoft_chunk_61', 'doc_id': 'microsoft', 'path': 'microsoft.md', 'filename': 'microsoft.md', 'chunk_index': 61, 'content': '## Fiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023\n\nRevenue increased $33.2 billion or 16% driven by growth across each of our segments.

- **Microsoft:** **16%** revenue growth

For fiscal year 2024, Apple's revenue growth rate was reported at 2%. This figure is derived from an increase in net sales from $383,285 million in fiscal year 2023 to $391,035 million in fiscal year 2024.

On the other hand, Microsoft experienced a more significant increase with a revenue growth rate of 16% for the same period. This growth amounted to an additional $33.2 billion compared to its fiscal year 2023 revenues.

In summary, when comparing the revenue growth rates for fiscal year 2024, Microsoft had a substantially higher growth rate at 16%, while Apple's growth rate was only 2%. Therefore, Microsoft achieved a higher revenue growth rate than Apple in fiscal year 2024."

- **Microsoft:** **$109.4 billion** operating income (24% growth)
- **Comparison:** Microsoft’s **operating income grew significantly** compared to Apple’s slower revenue growth.";"To determine which company, Apple or Microsoft, had higher operating income in fiscal year 2024, we can compare their respective figures based on available data. According to Document 3 under ""INCOME STATEMENTS,"" Apple Inc.'s operating income for a calendar-based reporting period ending June 30, 2024, was $109,433 million. It's important to note that this figure is based on a calendar year rather than Apple’s fiscal year, which typically ends in September. This discrepancy suggests potential adjustments might be necessary if comparing strictly within Apple's fiscal framework.

For Microsoft, the operating income for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, was reported as $109.433 billion, as indicated in the same document under ""INCOME STATEMENTS."" Since both companies' figures are from periods ending on June 30, they can be directly compared without adjustments for different fiscal year end dates.

In conclusion, both Apple and Microsoft had identical operating incomes of approximately $109.433 billion for their respective reporting periods ending June 30, 2024. Therefore, neither company outperformed the other in terms of operating income for that specific timeframe."
