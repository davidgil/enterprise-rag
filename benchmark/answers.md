1 | What was Apple's total revenue for fiscal year 2024?

================================================================================

Based on the retrieved documents, Apple's total net sales for fiscal year 2024 were $391,035 million. This figure represents their total revenue for that period. 

Additionally, Document 2 notes that there was $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that had been included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023. However, the "Total net sales" amount already incorporates this recognized revenue, so it does not require further adjustment for total revenue calculation.

Therefore, Apple's total revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $391,035 million.

================================================================================

2 | How did Apple's revenue change from 2023 to 2024?

================================================================================

Apple's total net sales increased by 2% from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, the total net sales were $383,285 million, and in 2024, they rose to $391,035 million. This increase reflects a positive change in revenue for Apple over that period.

================================================================================

3 | What was Apple's revenue growth rate between 2023 and 2024?

================================================================================

Based on the provided documents, Apple Inc.'s total net sales for 2023 were $383,285 million, and for 2024 they were $391,035 million. To calculate the revenue growth rate from 2023 to 2024:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Net Sales in 2024} - \text{Net Sales in 2023}}{\text{Net Sales in 2023}}\right) \times 100
\]

\[
= \left(\frac{391,035 - 383,285}{383,285}\right) \times 100
\]

\[
= \left(\frac{7,750}{383,285}\right) \times 100 \approx 2.02\%
\]

Therefore, Apple's revenue growth rate between 2023 and 2024 was approximately 2%.

================================================================================

4 | What was Apple's revenue growth rate between 2022 and 2023?

================================================================================

To calculate Apple's revenue growth rate between 2022 and 2023, we use the formula for percentage change:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue in 2023} - \text{Revenue in 2022}}{\text{Revenue in 2022}} \right) \times 100
\]

From Document 1, we have:
- Total net sales for 2023: $383,285 million
- Total net sales for 2022: $394,328 million

Plug these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{383,285 - 394,328}{394,328} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{-11,043}{394,328} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Growth Rate} \approx -2.8\%
\]

Therefore, Apple's revenue growth rate between 2022 and 2023 was approximately \(-2.8\%\).

14 | What was Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2024?

================================================================================

Based on the retrieved documents, there are two sets of financial data for Microsoft in the fiscal year 2024. 

From Document 1, which appears to be a part of Note 3 - Earnings Per Share:

- Basic earnings per share (EPS) for 2024 is $6.11
- Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for 2024 is $6.08

From Document 2, which summarizes the results of operations:

- Diluted EPS for 2024 is $11.80 

The discrepancy suggests that these documents might pertain to different segments or aspects of Microsoft's financial reporting. To provide a comprehensive answer based on this data, Microsoftâ€™s diluted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2024 could be reported as both $6.08 and $11.80 depending on the context:

- $6.08 from Document 1
- $11.80 from Document 2

Without additional data or documents that include Microsoft's financial figures for the same period, I am unable to determine which company had higher total revenue in fiscal year 2024.
